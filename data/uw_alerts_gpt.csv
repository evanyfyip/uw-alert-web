The UW's Seattle campus on-site operations will be suspended Friday, Dec. 23, due to icy conditions in the area. UW Bothell and UW Tacoma had previously announced they will also maintain remote operations through Friday, Dec. 23. Please continue to check with your individual units, programs and campuses for more information.

Units are authorized to implement elements of their Business, Academic and Research Continuity (BARC) plans, as needed, to maintain critical functions.

More information will be provided here if there is any change in Seattle campus operations. Updates on weather-related plans at UW Bothell will be reported as they become available, and can be found at uwb.edu/emergency. Updates for UW Tacoma can be found at tacoma.uw.edu/emergency. Weather-related Information for UW Medicine sites can be found at uwmedicine.org.

Please use caution when walking or driving on and around UW campuses. Here are some tips from UW Environmental Health & Safety to prevent slips, trips and falls while walking in wet or icy conditions.

The University encourages staff to work from home during suspended operations if operationally feasible.

Nonessential staff

If UW temporarily suspends nonessential operations due to severe weather or for other reasons, nonessential staff who can telework are encouraged to continue to do so during the operational suspension. Those who cannot telework or are unable to continue teleworking due to power outages or other impacts should follow the UW Suspended Operations Policy.

Essential staff

Under the UW Suspended Operations Policy, only staff performing essential functions and who are not in positions that lend themselves to telework are required to report to work on-site during suspended operations.

If you have questions about HR practices during suspended operations and inclement weather, please contact your unit's Human Resources Consultant. If you have questions about or need assistance with business continuity planning, please contact UW Emergency Management.

You can find helpful tools for assisting with suspended operations on the ISC's website. Managers can review which employees in their Sup Org hold ""essential positions"" and quickly prioritize who to contact in case of suspended operations by running the R0023 Emergency Contacts by Organization report in Workday (to find the report, type R0023 into the search box in Workday). In addition, non-essential employees can review the ISC's Suspended Operations webpage for guidance on how to record time when operations are suspended.

Normal operations are expected to resume on the Seattle campus Tuesday, Feb. 16. Any updates will be announced accordingly.

With the University already in modified operational status due to COVID-19 - and due to the holiday weekend - the potential effect of this temporary suspension of nonessential operations due to weather conditions may be minimized because many employees, instructors and students should be able to continue their activities from their alternative work locations.

UW Bothell and UW Tacoma have also suspended operations through Monday. Visit uwb.edu/emergency for UW Bothell updates. Visit emergency.tacoma.uw.edu for UW Tacoma updates.

Nonessential employeesUnder current COVID-19 modified operations, the majority of the University's faculty, staff and student employees (defined in policy as nonessential to on-campus operations) are teleworking. Employees who are teleworking and scheduled to work Saturday should continue to do so during suspended operations. Those who cannot telework or are unable to continue teleworking due to weather-related impacts (e.g., power outage) or changes in telework circumstances as a result of operational suspension should follow the UW Suspended Operations Policy.

Essential employeesEmployees identified by their unit as performing an essential service - and who must come to campus during the COVID-19 pandemic - are required to report to work during any period of declared suspended operation.

Students and instructorsClasses that are being taught remotely should continue to do so during suspended operations. Instructors who are unable to teach remotely due to weather-related impacts should communicate directly with students and provide alternatives as appropriate. Students who are unable to participate remotely due to weather-related impacts should similarly communicate with their instructor. In-person instruction will not meet on campus during suspended operations. Instructors currently teaching in person should communicate in advance with students about expectations for remote instruction or alternative class assignments.

UW AthleticsFor updates regarding athletics events - which are being held with no spectators in attendance in adherence to state guidelines - please visit gohuskies.com or @UWAthletics on Twitter.

More informationIf you have questions about HR practices during suspended operations and inclement weather, please contact your unit's Human Resources Consultant. If you have questions about or need assistance with business continuity planning, please contact UW Emergency Management at disaster@uw.edu.

Bottom line: We hear you and we will take this feedback seriously moving forward.

The notification system is designed to provide information to the UW community about disruptions or emergencies that could threaten their safety. (Learn more about the notification system here). The first advisory was sent as a precaution about a protest that police had reason to believe was intended to incite violence, property damage and theft, and not as a peaceful demonstration intended to call attention to the very real and serious issue of systemic racism. In hindsight, it is clear that the initial note to avoid the area could be read as a directive to not attend a protest. That was not its intention but in retrospect, we should have been clearer and will aim to in the future.

Regarding the second message, the Safeway store near University Village was broken into and was being looted by several people. As part of this incident, an individual who we learned later is a UW student was assaulted by multiple people trying to force their way into the store. All of this occurred within a span of about 15 minutes and the decision was made to send a UW Alert message to advise the UW community about a potentially dangerous situation, especially considering the location which has student housing around it in multiple directions.

A nearby traffic camera that was pointed toward Safeway showed a peaceful group of protestors sitting in the Safeway parking lot, and some helicopter footage showed University Village itself was heavily guarded and clear of anyone except for police patrolling the area. UW police contacts on the ground reported the activity at Safeway, and confirmed that the broken windows and looting was out of view of these cameras. We made the decision to send the message based on the information available at the time and did not intend to imply that the full group was involved in any such activity.

Finally, every time the Crisis Communications Team is convened, we conduct an after-action review to assess, analyze and learn from every decision we make and every message we send. We understand that words matter, and we will take this feedback and consider it when making future decisions.",Original,54,144
