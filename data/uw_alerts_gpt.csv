Normal operations are expected to resume on the Seattle campus Tuesday, Feb. 16. Any updates will be announced accordingly.

With the University already in modified operational status due to COVID-19 – and due to the holiday weekend – the potential effect of this temporary suspension of nonessential operations due to weather conditions may be minimized because many employees, instructors and students should be able to continue their activities from their alternative work locations.

UW Bothell and UW Tacoma have also suspended operations through Monday. Visit uwb.edu/emergency for UW Bothell updates. Visit emergency.tacoma.uw.edu for UW Tacoma updates.

Nonessential employees

Under current COVID-19 modified operations, the majority of the University’s faculty, staff and student employees (defined in policy as nonessential to on-campus operations) are teleworking. Employees who are teleworking and scheduled to work Saturday should continue to do so during suspended operations. Those who cannot telework or are unable to continue teleworking due to weather-related impacts (e.g., power outage) or changes in telework circumstances as a result of operational suspension should follow the UW Suspended Operations Policy.

Essential employees

Employees identified by their unit as performing an essential service — and who must come to campus during the COVID-19 pandemic — are required to report to work during any period of declared suspended operation.

Students and instructors

Classes that are being taught remotely should continue to do so during suspended operations. Instructors who are unable to teach remotely due to weather-related impacts should communicate directly with students and provide alternatives as appropriate. Students who are unable to participate remotely due to weather-related impacts should similarly communicate with their instructor. In-person instruction will not meet on campus during suspended operations. Instructors currently teaching in person should communicate in advance with students about expectations for remote instruction or alternative class assignments.

6/3/20,,,,Protest,"A protest that police had reason to believe was intended to incite violence, property damage and theft","A message regarding Monday’s UW Advisory and UW Alert messages

We have heard concerns and criticism from many members of the UW community and beyond about the UW Advisory and UW Alert messages that went out Monday ahead of and during some demonstrations near University Village. Bottom line: We hear you and we will take this feedback seriously moving forward.

The notification system is designed to provide information to the UW community about disruptions or emergencies that could threaten their safety. (Learn more about the notification system here). The first advisory was sent as a precaution about a protest that police had reason to believe was intended to incite violence, property damage and theft, and not as a peaceful demonstration intended to call attention to the very real and serious issue of systemic racism. In hindsight, it is clear that the initial note to avoid the area could be read as a directive to not attend a protest. That was not its intention but in retrospect, we should have been clearer and will aim to in the future.

Regarding the second message, the Safeway store near University Village was broken into and was being looted by several people. As part of this incident, an individual who we learned later is a UW student was assaulted by multiple people trying to force their way into the store. All of this occurred within a span of about 15 minutes and the decision was made to send a UW Alert message to advise the UW community about a potentially dangerous situation, especially considering the location which has student housing around it in multiple directions.

A nearby traffic camera that was pointed toward Safeway showed a peaceful group of protestors sitting in the Safeway parking lot, and some helicopter footage showed University Village itself was heavily guarded and clear of anyone except for police patrolling the area. UW police contacts on the ground reported the activity at Safeway, and confirmed that the broken windows and looting was out of view of these cameras. We made the decision to send the message based on the information available at the time and did not intend to imply that the full group was involved in any such activity.

Finally, every time the Crisis Communications Team is convened, we conduct an after-action review to assess, analyze and learn from every decision we make and every message we send. We understand that words matter, and we will take this feedback and consider it when making future decisions.",Original,42,100

3/27/20,,,,Safety,UWPD urges community members to call 911 immediately if they see any crime in progress,"A message from UWPD regarding safety on campus

When it comes to safety on campus, the UWPD takes a community-based, student-centered approach to teach the importance of safety and security. These become lifelong skills and ultimately assist our campus community members in making safety a priority in their daily lives.

Due to the impact COVID-19 has had on our regular campus routines, UWPD’s approach to crime prevention has been modified in order to best protect our community. With far fewer people on campus due to stay-at-home restrictions, we don’t have as many eyes and ears on campus. Though officers continue to perform their usual duties, it is even more important now to embrace, accept and participate in the concept of “See Something, Say Something.”

Now, more than ever, it is a call to action for all of our community members to be vigilant. For example, call 911 whenever you see unauthorized individuals in closed buildings. Please do not let unauthorized people follow behind you when entering a locked building. Letting that occur may impact your safety and the safety of others, potentially increasing the likelihood of theft from the building. If someone does follow you into a building, report it to a supervisor, building coordinator or the police, and call 911 if you are concerned for your safety.

In addition to unauthorized persons in buildings, UWPD urges you to call 911 immediately if you see any crime in progress. With fewer people on campus it is possible you may be the only person witnessing a crime. Don’t rely on someone else to call 911, please do so yourself and immediately. Here are some additional tips as we continue to work together to provide safety and security for campus during the COVID-19 pandemic:

When walking on campus, pre-plan your route, take pathways that are established and well lit, walk confidently and pay attention to what is going on around you. Walk with a friend but do so observing social distancing guidelines.

If you see a crime in progress, immediately report it by dialing 911. Be prepared to describe what you are observing and offer a description of the individual or car that might be involved.

When necessary, remind friends not to congregate. Respect the guidance given about social distancing.

Keep abreast of pertinent COVID-19 information posts by the UW and the CDC.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, please be mindful that some individuals may be experiencing anxiety, trauma and anguish. If you are concerned about a friend or co-worker, please refer them to their supervisor or UW Human Resources: https://hr.uw.edu/. Please refer students to LiveWell resources: https://depts.washington.edu/livewell/. If this is a crisis or emergency, call 911 immediately for police, fire or medical assistance.",Original,47,114

During icy weather, there are some areas that may be slippery and other potential hazards exist.

Caution on walkways: To the extent possible, wear appropriate winter footwear, including waterproof boots and soles with proper tread. Many pathways have been treated within normal walkways. Not all walkways are treated from edge to edge. Pedestrians should look for treated or clear paths whenever possible, even if this isn’t the most direct path.

Limited ADA accessibility: Crews have prioritized ADA accessibility around campus and near ADA-designated parking areas, however they may be impacted by ice. Attention will continue to be placed on these areas.

Parking lots and garages: Please use caution walking and driving in parking lots and garages. Some transitions from lots and garages may be icy in spots. Also use extra caution getting in and out of vehicles.

Caution entering and exiting buildings: Custodial crews will aim to keep entryways into buildings as dry as possible, but please assist in the effort by wiping shoes off upon entering buildings. Use caution on non-carpeted flooring near entrances and exits as floors may be slippery.

UW Facilities have been at work since 4 a.m. clearing and treating roads, pathways and entryways, operating and maintaining the power plant, utilities distribution systems and critical building mechanical systems, and providing critical transportation services to enable an effective return to normal operations for the UW.

Please be advised that some areas of ice and slush remain in spots around campus, and people on campus are encouraged to be aware of the following:

Caution on walkways: To the extent possible, wear appropriate winter footwear, including waterproof boots and soles with proper tread. Many pathways have been cleared within normal walkways. Not all walkways are cleared from edge to edge, and some paths across open spaces are not entirely cleared.

Trees and building overhangs: Please be aware that as the snow and ice melts off trees and rooftops, clumps of ice and snow can fall to the ground below, and tree branches can also fall. Please be aware of such areas and use caution.

Limited ADA accessibility: Crews have prioritized ADA accessibility around campus and near ADA-designated parking areas, however they may be impacted by the ongoing slush and ice. Attention will continue to be placed on these areas.

Parking lots and garages: Please use caution walking and driving in parking lots and garages. Some transitions from lots and garages onto roads remain slushy or icy in spots. Also use extra caution getting in and out of vehicles.

Caution entering and exiting buildings: Custodial crews will aim to keep entryways into buildings as dry as possible, but please assist in the effort by wiping shoes off upon entering buildings and be mindful to avoid bringing ice inside. Use caution on non-carpeted flooring near entrances and exits as floors may be slippery.

Hundreds of UW Facilities personnel have logged tens of thousands of hours working around the clock for the last week and a half.

Due to continued snow accumulation, operations are suspended on the UW Seattle campus on Tuesday. Classes, activities and other events will be canceled. Please use caution if walking or driving on and around campus. The weight of accumulated snow on tree branches has caused some to break and fall. Please be aware of low-hanging or potentially falling branches. [UPDATE AT 7 a.m. Tuesday: Stevens Way has reopened after being closed overnight between Grant Lane and Rainier Vista, due to fallen branches.]

Faculty, staff and students with concerns about specific work, events or activities are encouraged to communicate with their supervisors, instructors and event organizers.

Employees identified by their unit as performing an essential service are required to report to work during any period of declared suspended operation. Employees in positions that are not designated as essential do not report to work when operations are suspended. These employees are covered by the pay and time-off policies that apply during periods of suspended operations.

Telework may be a feasible option both for employees in essential positions and for regular employees who would not normally work during a suspension of operations, so long as they have the advance written approval of their supervisor or manager. Non-essential employees and essential employees whose responsibilities can be accomplished through telework should not come to campus.

The annual test of the UW Indoor Alert system is scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 6, from approximately 7 to 7:30 a.m.

The UW Indoor Alert system is one of several tools used to communicate emergency information to the campus community. Messages can be broadcast to about 95 campus buildings in Seattle. “Reader boards” also are strategically located in about 45 buildings and garages.

If you are in a building with fire alarm speakers you can expect to hear chimes, horns or a voice announcement during the test. If you are in a building with a message or reader board, you can expect to see a message scrolling across the digital board. In either case you may see flashing emergency lights.

The annual test is designed to ensure that the system operates as expected and that the proper messages and audible queues are triggered.",Original,86,231
