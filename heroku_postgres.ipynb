      "When it comes to safety on campus, the UWPD takes a community-based, student-centered approach to teach the importance of safety and security. These become lifelong skills and ultimately assist our campus community members in making safety a priority in their daily lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the impact COVID-19 has had on our regular campus routines, UWPD’s approach to crime prevention has been modified in order to best protect our community. With far fewer people on campus due to stay-at-home restrictions, we don’t have as many eyes and ears on campus. Though officers continue to perform their usual duties, it is even more important now to embrace, accept and participate in the concept of “See Something, Say Something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, more than ever, it is a call to action for all of our community members to be vigilant. For example, call 911 whenever you see unauthorized individuals in closed buildings. Please do not let unauthorized people follow behind you when entering a locked building. Letting that occur may impact your safety and the safety of others, potentially increasing the likelihood of theft from the building. If someone does follow you into a building, report it to a supervisor, building coordinator or the police, and call 911 if you are concerned for your safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to unauthorized persons in buildings, UWPD urges you to call 911 immediately if you see any crime in progress. With fewer people on campus it is possible you may be the only person witnessing a crime. Don’t rely on someone else to call 911, please do so yourself and immediately. Here are some additional tips as we continue to work together to provide safety and security for campus during the COVID-19 pandemic:\n",
      "\n",
      "When walking on campus, pre-plan your route, take pathways that are established and well lit, walk confidently and pay attention to what is going on around you. Walk with a friend but do so observing social distancing guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you see a crime in progress, immediately report it by dialing 911. Be prepared to describe what you are observing and offer a description of the individual or car that might be involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "When necessary, remind friends not to congregate. Respect the guidance given about social distancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep abreast of pertinent COVID-19 information posts by the UW and the CDC.\n",
